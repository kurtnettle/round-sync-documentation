# History


Round Sync has a long history. It was first concieved as "[Rclone Explorer](https://github.com/patrykcoding/rcloneExplorer)" by [Patryk Kaczmarkiewicz](https://github.com/patrykcoding). After this, [x0b](https://github.com/x0b) took over, with [rcx](https://github.com/x0b/rcx) as a new name.

After that it became Round Sync.
