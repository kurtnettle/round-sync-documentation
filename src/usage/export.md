# Import/Export

If you want to migrate this application to another device, or restore the configuration, you can refer to this section.

First, open the navigation drawer.

In the options-section you will find both the import and export buttons.

### Export:

To export all application-settings, triggers, tasks and remotes, just click the "Export Config"-button. You will then be asked to select a folder where the backup will be stored.

### Import:

To restore such a backup, start the application. Then open the navigation drawer, and click the "Import Config"-button. You will then be asked to select a file.

You can either select the backup you created earlier, or a standalone rclone.conf-file.
