# Translations


## Android Studio
The easiest way to edit translations is via the Android Studio Translations-Editor. You can open it by navigating to the `res`-folder in the project view (left sidebar). In there, select the `values` folder and open the `strings.xml`. Android Studio will now ask you to use the Editor. Select `Open editor` in the upper-right corner.


## Manually

You can also check out the repository without Android Studio, and edit the translation-files directly.
The "base"-file is this one: [app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml](https://github.com/newhinton/Round-Sync/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)
The german translation is in this file: [app/src/main/res/values-de/strings.xml](https://github.com/newhinton/Round-Sync/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values-de/strings.xml)
As you can see, you need to create an value-XX folder, and then tanslate the strings.xml file. XX corresponds to your language's ISO 639 code.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) has a list of valid codes.
